⏳ Learning Timeline
1. Initial Setup (1–2 days)
Install Prometheus and configure it to scrape metrics from your Spring Boot app.

Add the Micrometer dependency in Spring Boot (it exposes metrics automatically).

Run Prometheus locally and confirm metrics are being collected.

2. Grafana Basics (2–3 days)
Install Grafana and connect it to Prometheus as a data source.

Learn how to create simple dashboards (CPU, memory, request latency).

Explore pre-built Grafana dashboards for Spring Boot to save time.

3. Intermediate Skills (1 week)
Build custom queries using PromQL (Prometheus Query Language).

Create Grafana panels for business metrics (e.g., API response times, error rates).

Configure alerts in Prometheus and Grafana for proactive monitoring.

4. Advanced Monitoring (2–4 weeks ongoing practice)
Integrate logs and traces with OpenTelemetry for full observability.

Learn dashboard best practices (grouping, templating, annotations).

Automate deployment with Docker/Kubernetes for production-ready monitoring.



📊 Effort Breakdown
Skill Area	                     Time Estimate	    Notes
Prometheus basics	              1–2 days	        Installing, scraping Spring Boot metrics
Grafana basics	                  2–3 days	        Dashboards, connecting to Prometheus
PromQL queries	                  3–5 days	        Needed for custom metrics
Alerts & notifications	          2–3 days	        Email/Slack integration
Advanced observability	          2–4 weeks	        Logs, traces, Kubernetes setup


⚠️ Challenges & Tips
PromQL learning curve: Writing queries can feel tricky at first. Start with simple ones like rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count[1m]).

Dashboard overload: Avoid too many panels; focus on actionable metrics.

Production readiness: Local setup is easy, but scaling in Kubernetes requires more time.



✅ Practical Advice for You, PRATHEUSH
Since you already troubleshoot Kubernetes and Spring Boot, you’ll likely progress faster:

Day 1–2: Get Prometheus scraping Spring Boot metrics via Micrometer.

Day 3–5: Build Grafana dashboards for JVM, HTTP requests, and DB connections.

Week 2: Add alerts and experiment with PromQL.

Beyond: Integrate with Kubernetes monitoring (Grafana + Prometheus Operator).

This way, you’ll have a working monitoring stack in under two weeks, and mastery will come with ongoing use.
