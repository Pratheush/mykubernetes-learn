Want me to add a ConfigMap or VolumeMount example next? Or maybe show how to expose the Service externally using NodePort or LoadBalancer ?

Would you like me to also extend this with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) so you can see how Kubernetes auto-scales Nginx pods based on CPU load?

Would you like to expose it externally using LoadBalancer next, or set up an Ingress for cleaner routing?


what is config maps in kubernetes explain with example and yaml file.


what is replicaset and statefulset and daemonset in kubernetes









Thanks for sharing that, PRATHEUSH. You're running Kubernetes inside **WSL2**, which means your node IP `172.18.0.2` is **not directly accessible from your browser**—it’s part of an internal virtual network. That’s why `http://10.96.247.193:30080/` didn’t work either.

But no worries—we can still expose your service externally. Here are your best options:

---

## 🛠️ Option 1: Use `kubectl port-forward` (Quick & Local)

This is the easiest way to access your service from your browser:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/my-service 8080:80
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8080/
```

> This tunnels traffic from your local machine to the service inside the cluster. No need to mess with NodePorts or IPs.

---

## 🚀 Option 2: Use `nginx` or `traefik` Ingress (Advanced & Persistent)

If you want a more permanent setup with custom domains or paths, you can install an Ingress controller:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.10.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

Then define an `Ingress` resource to route traffic to your service. This works well with WSL2 if you expose the ingress port via Windows.

## 🧠 Bonus: WSL2 Networking Quirks

WSL2 uses a **virtual network bridge**, so even NodePort won’t expose services to your Windows browser unless you forward ports manually or use tools like `socat` or `netsh`.

If you want to expose NodePort to Windows, you can try:

```bash
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=30080 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=30080 connectaddress=172.18.0.2
```

Then access:
```
http://localhost:30080/
```

Let me know if you want to automate this with PowerShell or integrate it into your Jenkins pipeline for preview environments. I’ve got ideas for that too.
